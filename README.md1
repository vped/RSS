I have done some modification on Raphael Js Free-Transform. Thought to share it. 
In raphael free transform, there are 8 corners from where we can resize the element.
But the cursor type is same for all 8 corners. I have modified cursor type as respect to their corners.
And also added curosr for rotate option.
